  "I'm a self-taught, trial by fire, dev looking to get into your code and build cool things with you. My coding journey began over 20 years ago with BASIC and Turbo Pascal. This soon turned into HTML, inline styles, frames, and tables as a student worker in undergrad, and I enjoyed the hell out of that job. However, I went down a different career path and found myself in graduate school and pursuing another career.",
  "I’ve spent the past 10 years as a behavioral health therapist where I spend much of my time solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable components. But unlike coding I don’t get to see the results and interact with it. Which is why, when I immersed myself in coding again and began to see and interact with the results, it reignited that passion, and I haven’t turned back since.",
  "I'm a self-starter with a passion for learning new things. I spend every minute of free time coding, reading articles, and watching coding videos. I have successfully completed the freeCodeCamp Front-end Certification course and am working towards the Back-end and Full Stack certifications as well as other courses. I find myself absorbing all the information like a sponge and crave more knowledge."
